My solutions for
    [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

They are meant to be run through
    [kscript](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript),

```bash
kscript scr/main/kotlin/01.kts 01_input
```

Written for Kotlin 1.4 and kscript 3.0.
Add Gradle 6.7 so IDEA 2020.3 gets its act together.
